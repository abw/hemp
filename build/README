This is the build directory for hemp.  You can safely delete the contents
of this directory at any time and rebuild hemp.  See the ../INSTALL file
for details.  Oh go on then, I'll tell you how to do it in case you're 
the impatient type.  It goes something like this:

  $ cmake ..
  $ make
  $ make test
  $ sudo make install

There.  Are you happy now?

Don't forget to read the ../INSTALL file.  No, really.  It contains 
some important information about the pre-alpha state of hemp which
means that the probability of it building on your system are pretty
slim right now (unless you happen to have a shiny Snow Leopard Mac,
in which case, Rock On!).  But that's probably small consolation if
you've already tried the above and found out that it doesn't even 
compile.  Well, I warned you.  Or I would have done if you had taken
the time to read the ../INSTALL file like I suggested.  What do you
mean you're busy and you didn't have time to read it?  Well sure,
that's fine, but then you can't lay the heavy guilt trip on me 
because it doesn't build on your system.  Refund?  You want a
refund?  Sure, I'll give you back twice what you paid for it.
Ha.  See!  You're getting it for free.  Well, OK, maybe 
you're not getting it at all.  Perhaps that explains 
why you're being so edgy.  You *are* being edgy.
I mean, you got all uptight because it didn't
compile and just started cursing about
stupid free software and how it
never works out of the box 
and why doesn't someone 
try and do it better.
Well that someone
is me, or rather
it would be me
