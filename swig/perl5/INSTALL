To build and install the Perl5 interface to the hemp library you must first
build the hemp library by running './configure', 'make' and 'make install'
in the top-level directory for this project.  

You'll also need to install SWIG (for now at least).  See http://www.swig.org

Then run the following commands:

    $ ./mkswig
    $ perl Makefile.PL
    $ make
    $ make test
    $ sudo make install

Don't expect anything to work.  At the moment it's little more than a 
placeholder for future effort.
