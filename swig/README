This directory contains code for generating SWIG wrapper interfaces around
the hemp library that allow it to be loaded and used from other programming
languages.  At present, there's only a *very* basic test for Perl5.

For further information on SWIG, see http://www.swig.org

UPDATE: The code generated is completely impenetrable to me.  I'm going to
start by hand-rolling a nice, simple wrapper.  See ../../langauge/perl.
