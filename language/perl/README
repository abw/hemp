This is a first attempt at writing a simple Perl wrapper around hemp.
It's been a long time since I did any XS coding or had to think how to
load a C library and make everything work as it should, so there is a 
fair bit of stabbing in the dark going on...

For now, at least, you need to build and install hemp in the top level 
directory first:

    $ cd ../..
    $ ./configure
    $ make
    $ make check
    $ sudo make install

Then you can build the Perl wrapper:

    $ cd language/perl
    $ perl Makefile.PL
    $ make
    $ make test
    $ sudo make install

Note, however, that it doesn't actually do anything useful yet.  
It really is the barest shell of a wrapper module.
