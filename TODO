An incomplete list of things TODO, in no particular order.

* hemp_element_parse_block() and various other methods need access to the 
  elements factory.  I think this should probably be encasulated in the 
  scope object.

* double and single quoted strings need to check for backslashes and 
  and generate constant values on demand.

* Control tags and double quoted strings need to have tokens hanging off
  a BRANCH (or we need to figure out a different way to skin this cat 
  compared to how the Perl TT3 prototype works).  next() might need to 
  become a method dispatched via the element vtable.

* Figure out what needs to go into the element data structure value union
  to represent all the various different element types.

* Decide how to represent values and implement.  I want to try and unify as 
  much of the API between elements and values as possible.
