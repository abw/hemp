An incomplete list of things TODO, in no particular order.

* hemp_element_parse_block() and various other methods need access to the 
  elements factory.  I think this should probably be encasulated in the 
  scope object.

* double and single quoted strings need to check for backslashes and 
  and generate constant values on demand.  The default text  method for 
  quoted strings (hemp_element_quoted_text()) returns the source token 
  "tucked in" by one character at each end to remove the quotes.  Once we've 
  got proper tokenisation working (i.e. identifying escaped characters and
  interpolated variables) then we can mark quoted values as literal or 
  otherwise and only generate a value for non-literal strings when required.

* Control tags and double quoted strings need to have tokens hanging off
  a BRANCH (or we need to figure out a different way to skin this cat 
  compared to how the Perl TT3 prototype works).  next() might need to 
  become a method dispatched via the element vtable.

* Figure out what needs to go into the element data structure value union
  to represent all the various different element types.

* Decide how to represent values and implement.  I want to try and unify as 
  much of the API between elements and values as possible.

* This is my first time using autotools, and I'm sure I've made plenty of
  nooby mistakes.  The whole autoconf/automake/libtool setup needs cleaning
  up, ideally by someone more familiar with the tools than me.
