An incomplete list of things TODO, in no particular order.
---------------------------------------------------------

* Clean up all the include declaration and definitions.  According to the
  C99 and GNU99 standards, they probably shouldn't work because of the 
  extern inline on both the declarations and definitions.  The compiler 
  complains and fails if -pedantic is enabled, but it seems to work OK 
  on the platforms I've tested it on (OSX/Linux).  In fact, the combination
  of extern and inline was the only way to prevent duplicate symbols and all
  sorts of other problems.  So it's good enough for now, but needs to be 
  done properly.  I need to go back and read this page again in detail:
  http://www.greenend.org.uk/rjk/2003/03/inline.html

* decide on a _FUNC suffix or otherwise and apply consistently, e.g.
  HEMP_GRAMMAR() vs HEMP_PREFIX()

* There's still a bunch of components with init() methods which need
  changing to new() for consistency with new naming standard.
 
* Add pairs method (%stuff) and items/fetch_all (@stuff)

* Add parse_body() method and change those elements currently using 
  parse_block.  Add default handler that returns self (single expression
  body) and block-slurping handlers for "{...}", ";...;end" and 
  "%]...[% end %]".  UPDATE: added parse_body() and applied to sub and 
  apply elements.  Needs changing in some other elements.
  
* Add sigils

* Add parallel assignment: @foo = @bar, (a, b, c) = (1, 2, 3)

* Add @list and %hash items to prototypes.

* Add arrows.  a => 10, b -> 10, list.each <- block(x) { ...x... }

* hemp_element_parse_block() and various other methods need access to the 
  elements factory.  I think this should probably be encapsulated in the 
  scope object.

* double quoted string should accept embedded variables.

* Control tags and double quoted strings need to have tokens hanging off
  a BRANCH (or we need to figure out a different way to skin this cat 
  compared to how the Perl TT3 prototype works).  next() might need to 
  become a method dispatched via the element vtable.

* Figure out what needs to go into the element data structure value union
  to represent all the various different element types.

* filesystem is a quick hack... needs doing properly

* Factory used named passed as argument to cache instance in hash.  We
  can't guarantee that it's statically allocated.  Previous we used the 
  allocated name in, e.g. dialect->name. UPDATE: now we can use tagged 
  values.

* Figure out a nice way to implement exceptions.  Ideally we want the 
  flexibility of the Perl/Badger approach that allows a main error type to
  be defined (e.g. parse error), along with sub-type and any arguments.
  This should result in a nice error message being generated from the 
  type/subtype and args.  UPDATE: got some of the way there with hemp_throw()
  and hemp_error_init() functions.  Now need to be able to add things like
  source position / scope for parse errors.

* Add a fallback mechanism to the various factories.  e.g. if a tt3 dialect
  is requested and not found then the fallback should call hemp_language("tt3")
  to give it a chance to load it.  Just got to be careful we don't end up in
  a deathly spiral if we then re-attempt the lookup and it fails again.

* Perl CODE - we can call Perl code refs, but we don't pass any arguments
  yet.  Also need to handle multiple return values.

* change function names in type/* from hemp_value_XXX_YYY to hemp_type_XXX_YYY

* boolean vs truth: decide on the best terminology and stick to it.

* Clean up all the macros and inline functions so that they're consistently
  name, e.g. HEMP_IS_NUM() and so on.  Change 'num' to 'number' and so on.

* figure out what to do with number/integer operators that return boolean
  values (e.g. less than).  Is it an error to ask for those as int/num?
  I think so...

* figure out how to scan/parse items.1.2.3 and not have the scanner parse
  it as (items).(1.2).3 (with a float in the middle)
  
* Create view object to walk element tree using symbol->namespace->id,
  following parent. (first attempt done, needs more work)

* Change grammar definitions to fit hierarchy corresponding to operator type
  e.g. hemp.operator.binary.number.add allows a single view method to be
  defined for hemp.operator.binary which renders all binary operators using
  a similar process (e.g.for syntax highlighting)

* Extend parse_fixed() to lookahead and merge with other fixed items 
  (equivalent to filename in TT3).  No... hang on, that's a different
  thing - we want filenames (uris) to be greedy, but a single fixed value
  after a dotop should not be.

* element->next pointers could be broken by recent change to add 
  synthesised elements on the end, after EOF.  But there are places that 
  skip down the next chain and could possibly bypass EOF.

* Add support for literal elements (other than word and number) being used
  as fixed tokens (merge/refactor token, source, etc., at the same time).

* Pre-defined symbols like start_tag and end_tag should be bound to a grammar
  so we don't get exceptions like when parse_block() wants to create a new
  block element and needs an elements reference (which includes needing a 
  grammar reference along the way).  Tags should pre-match the start_tag/end_tag
  symbols via the grammar.

* The current implementation for function parameters using context, frame
  and params results in all parameters for a function becoming global 
  dynamic variable in the current context.  It's all a bit of a mess and
  needs a bit of a re-think.

* Dynamic module loading.  Got a basic working implementation using dlopen(),
  and friends, but it needs generalising for other platforms and making more
  robust.

* Improve URI parsing to handle incremental matching during scanning phase.
  UPDATE: nah, that's not going to work - see NOTES in uri.c

* Figure out how to represent parameters with multiple values in uri.c

* Percent encoding for URIs, implemented as a codec module

* Might want to add name parameter to module binder function so that we
  can do the equivalent of "use x as y".  Hmm... although I suppose the 
  names that it registers are supposed to be namespaced and unique. Hmm.

* HEMP_ACTION

* Clean up scanner errors, number parse errors, etc., including quoted strings
  UPDATE: scanner errors (e.g. in quoted.c) have been cleaned up, and errors
  have been improved a little.  But there's more that can be done.  In particular
  I want to switch to a namespace-based error type, e.g. hemp.error.scan.whatever.
  That gives us the built-in walk-up mechanism for matching against more general
  type handler, and it also gives us a unique id that we can use to jump with.
  A namespace-based solution also makes it easier to render error messages from
  templates, e.g. /path/to/hemp/templates/hemp/error/scan/whatever

* Operator precedence.  Various commands (e.g. with), do this in postfix mode

    return hemp_parse_postfix(
        fragptr, scope, precedence, 0,
        fragment
    );

  I'm fairly certain that forwarding the passed precedence, rather than 
  type->rprec is the correct thing to do.  But I need to convince myself
  again...

* Boolean and/or ops should short-circuit.  This also implies that they 
  should be able to return values other than booleans.

* Memory leaks:
  - tests/language/hemp/assign shows a memory leak.  Looks like the proto
    created for a sub isn't being cleaned up (probably just needs a cleanup
    function).

  - tests/language/hemp/list shows a leak.  Looks like a value list that 
    isn't being freed (probably needs to switch from a hemp_list_new() to 
    a hemp_context_tmp_list() to have context manage the memory)

  - /tests/language/hemp/with shows a leak, but it looks like it's the 
    fixed pair names (x, y) that aren't being freed.  Also 'just' test.
    UPDATE: looks like the problem is in hemp_element_word_prefix().  
    The backtracking caused by word->parse_pair() failing means that 
    hemp_element_word_prefix() can get called multiple times.  Worse still,
    there could be other expression elements that allocate memory.
    It suggests that backtracking should be avoided wherever possible.
    Either that or we need to explicitly call cleanup() for any and all
    elements between the backtrack and current points that define them.

* Standardise on free/cleanup function, e.g. hemp_type_wipe() and 
  hemp_type_free() vs hemp_text_release()

* Fix the bug that stops keywords being used as fixed words.  
  e.g. list.each fails when .each is a keyword.  It parses OK (because 
  it inherits the parse_fixed method from literal), but the runtime 
  doesn't account for it.  The parse_fixed method should be changed to
  "re-bless" the fragment to a static word element
  UPDATE: now fixed, but there may be consequences.  Lots of elements 
  default to using hemp_element_literal() as a base class, so will need
  to explicitly clear/reset the parse_fixed() method if they don't already..

* Fix tokeniser(s) (json is broken, probably others) so that it accepts
  underscores in unquoted words (hash keys).


Operators
---------

* Number ops:
    - Add ++ and -- auto-increment operator

* Text ops:
    - textify prefix operator: ~

* Range ops:

    -   "to" and "by"

        %% 1 to 10
        %% 5 to 100 by 5     # 5, 10, 15 ... 90, 95, 100
        %% 5 by 5            # 5, 10, 15 ...

        Initial approach can coerce to numerics just to get something working.
        Ultimately, rangeability/enumerability/whatever-you-wanna-call-it should
        be a facet/role/feature/whatever-you-wanna-call-it of the underlying 
        data type.

* Boolean ops:
    -   'in' as a boolean existential operator

        %% if x in y { ... }

* Arrow ops
    - Parameter arrow: =>
    - Function arrow: ->
    - Applicative arrow: <-


Commands
--------

* for list ...
* for item in list ...          # issue of declaring "in" token
* ... for list
* ... for item in list

* fill template
* data template                 # or 'load'?
* into
* layout
* with                          # in progress

* block/slot



Data Structures
---------------

Some other data structure we might want to add:

* IP V4/V6 addresses (used in full uri parsing)

    struct hemp_ipv4 {
        hemp_uchar octet[4];             /* 1 bytes per octet */
    }

    struct hemp_ipv6 {
        hemp_uchar data[16];            /* 2 bytes per quad */
        // or 
        hemp_quad  quad[8];
    }


Hot Stack
---------

A reminder of what I'm working towards right now...

LRU cache.  Needs hash delete (working but not thoroughly tested) and 
re-freshening of used items (also implemented but barely tested).  Also
needs delete/empty methods.

Finish off test dialect.  Depends on merging/refactoring current test plan
and figuring out how to generate output in a generic and extensible way
(e.g. to enable colour, switch between text and html, and so on).

Hemp config.  Any value with fetch() method.

config_file reads config from document using default data dialect, e.g. json

  hemp.config.file
  hemp.config.dialect

  hemp.data.path
  hemp.data.dialect

  hemp.document.path
  hemp.document.dialect

  etc

Let's start by making json a plugin language and have it autoload...[DONE]

Then create a JSON codec to read JSON data [DONE]

Rendering error messages via templates.


A bunch of things that haven't been renamed/refactored yet
----------------------------------------------------------

cleanup -> clean

doc_prep
doc_scan
doc_clean
hemp_cleanup

pool_iter
hash_iter/each
list_iter

source_vop
source_bop
view_f
hemp_view_f


"config" branch
---------------

Working on configuration from a json file.  Define default document 
configuration (added to Hemp).  Document providers also define their
own configs, with a parent on the Hemp config.  Then each document gets
its own config with a parent to the provider's config.

There will be occasions when we want to fetch all values in a config chain.
e.g. when adding features, we should find all features defines.  Add 
functions to hash: fetch_all() (returns list of all values found) and 
fetch_list() (merges them all into a single list, like Badger::Class
list_vars()).

Need to add value->items method to expand lists to items.  Consider
document_path.  Might be any of these:

    document_path: '/path/to/docs'
    document_path: 'file:/path/to/docs'
    document_path: { type: 'file', path: '/path/to/docs' }

Or could be a list:

    document_path: [
        '/path/to/docs',
        { ... },
    ]

Furthermore we can have chained config hashes.  So the fetch_list() function
must merge the values it finds into a single list.  However, it's not 
sufficient to simply test if the value isa list or text, because we also need
to support extensible data types (e.g. Perl scalar/list/object, Python, etc).
So the function calls the item->items() method against each item it finds.
This is like item->values(), except that the existing list object returns a
scalar reference to itself so that lists don't auto-collapse.  It'll also
be required for the '@' expansion sigil.
