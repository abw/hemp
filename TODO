An incomplete list of things TODO, in no particular order.

* hemp_element_parse_block() and various other methods need access to the 
  elements factory.  I think this should probably be encapsulated in the 
  scope object.

* double and single quoted strings need to check for backslashes and 
  and generate constant values on demand.  The default text  method for 
  quoted strings (hemp_element_quoted_text()) returns the source token 
  "tucked in" by one character at each end to remove the quotes.  Once we've 
  got proper tokenisation working (i.e. identifying escaped characters and
  interpolated variables) then we can mark quoted values as literal or 
  otherwise and only generate a value for non-literal strings when required.

* Control tags and double quoted strings need to have tokens hanging off
  a BRANCH (or we need to figure out a different way to skin this cat 
  compared to how the Perl TT3 prototype works).  next() might need to 
  become a method dispatched via the element vtable.

* Figure out what needs to go into the element data structure value union
  to represent all the various different element types.

* Change elements to be object values.

* This is my first time using autotools, and I'm sure I've made plenty of
  nooby mistakes.  The whole autoconf/automake/libtool setup needs cleaning
  up, ideally by someone more familiar with the tools than me

* Add cleanup methods for squote and dquote to release the text memory when
  HEMP_FLAG_FIXED is not set.  UPDATE: think that's done now.

* filesystem is a quick hack... needs doing properly

* Factory used named passed as argument to cache instance in hash.  We
  can't guarantee that it's statically allocated.  Previous we used the 
  allocated name in, e.g. dialect->name. UPDATE: now we can use tagged 
  values.

* Figure out a nice way to implement exceptions.  Ideally we want the 
  flexibility of the Perl/Badger approach that allows a main error type to
  be defined (e.g. parse error), along with sub-type and any arguments.
  This should result in a nice error message being generated from the 
  type/subtype and args.  UPDATE: got some of the way there with hemp_throw()
  and hemp_error_init() functions.  Now need to be able to add things like
  source position / scope for parse errors.

* Add a fallback mechanism to the various factories.  e.g. if a tt3 dialect
  is requested and not found then the fallback should call hemp_language("tt3")
  to give it a chance to load it.  Just got to be careful we don't end up in
  a deathly spiral if we then re-attempt the lookup and it fails again.

 
-- HOT STACK --

* postfix element should have option (HEMP_BE_POSTBOUND?) that space lookahead 
  (hemp_element_next_postfix()) can check to see if it allows space before it
  when used as a postfix operator.  This is so that () [] {} can be required 
  to bind tight when used for function application / element access, e.g.
  foo(bar), foo[bar], foo{bar} while rejecting those cases where spaces are 
  present, treating them instead as separate expressions, e.g. 
  foo (bar) [bar] {baz=10}

* Add postfix handler to parens to create args for function application

* Add args() method to element and provide implementation for ()

* Add hemp_args_s data structure

* Add context caller/argument stack, or something similar to pass args from
  one place to another.

* Perl CODE

* Add apply() method to value types (or call() ?)

* change function names in type/* from hemp_value_XXX_YYY to hemp_type_XXX_YYY

* Have static symbols created at global startup time in the same way that 
  value type now are. (now done?)

* Change elements to be values so that we can have a single value() and 
  text() interface instead of the similar (but not quite identical) 
  hemp_eval_f and hemp_value_f typedefs.  UPDATE: started doing this from 
  the inside, so that elements hold values (object tagged element pointers)
  in their expr/lhs/rhs slots.

* boolean vs truth: decide on the best terminology and stick to it.

* Clean up all the macros and inline functions so that they're consistently
  name, e.g. HEMP_IS_NUM() and so on.  Change 'num' to 'number' and so on.

* Number ops:
   - Add ++ and -- auto-increment operator

* Text ops:
   - textify prefix operator: ~

* figure out what to do with number/integer operators that return boolean
  values (e.g. less than).  Is it an error to ask for those as int/num?
  I think so...

* figure out how to scan/parse items.1.2.3 and not have the scanner parse
  it as (items).(1.2).3 (with a float in the middle)
  
* Create view object to walk element tree using symbol->namespace->id,
  following parent. (first attempt done, needs more work)

* Change grammar definitions to fit hierarchy corresponding to operator type
  e.g. hemp.operator.binary.number.add allows a single view method to be
  defined for hemp.operator.binary which renders all binary operators using
  a similar process (e.g.for syntax highlighting)

* Should OPERATOR2 register terminator token?  e.g. in:
    HEMP_OPERATOR2("hemp.bracket.parens",       "(", ")",     0,    0);

* change fixed() parse function to name()... on second thoughts, keep it 
  because it fits nicely with prefix/postfix, but consider changing them all
  to parse_infix(), etc., because we've got more parsing methods to add and 
  there's a danger they will clash or be confused with evaluation methods.

* add signature() parse function, or perhaps a flag in parens to indicate 
  that it can provide a formal parameter list.
