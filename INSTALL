Fair Warning
------------

Please be aware that hemp is still a work in progress.  I've been developing
on 64 bit OSX (Snow Leopard) where it should compile without warnings and all
tests usually pass (although I'm still at the stage of breaking things 
periodically, so don't be surprised if they don't).

The last time I checked it on 32 bit Linux (a few days ago at the time of 
writing), I discovered that I had cocked up some of the macros that implement
the NAN-boxing of values (in values.h), leading to complete failure in a 
steaming pile of segfault FAIL.  I laugh at the idea of even trying to compile
it on a windows box at this time.

So although cross-platform support is an important goal, we're nowhere near 
that point yet.  But don't feel too bad if it doesn't work for you - Hemp 
doesn't even do anything practically useful right now, so you're not missing 
out.  That said, any contributions to clean up the problems on Linux, etc., 
would be most welcome now or at any time in the future.


Instructions for Installing Hemp
--------------------------------

You first need to install CMake which handles the configuration, build and 
installation process.  You can download it from here:

    http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html

Or you can install it using your favourite package manager (apt, ports, etc).

If you haven't already checked out the hemp source then you need to do that 
next.

    $ git clone git://github.com/abw/hemp.git
    $ cd hemp

It is recommended that you use the 'build' sub-directory for building hemp.
Run cmake in this directory, specifying '..' as an argument so that it can
find the relevant configuration files in the top-level hemp directory.

    $ cd build
    $ cmake ..

NOTE: CMake provides various different commands to use, depending on your
operating system.  For example, on Unix-like systems you can use 'ccmake'
instead of 'cmake' to enable the configuration manager.  On Windows there's
the CMakeSetup.exe application which provides a point-and-clicky thing so 
that you don't have to dirty yourself with the command line.  See this page 
for further information:

    http://www.cmake.org/cmake/help/runningcmake.html

Then run make, make test, and make install (for which you'll probably need 
sudo to grant you write permission to the installation location)

    $ make
    $ make test
    $ sudo make install

NOTE: Hemp is not guaranteed to compile and/or pass all the tests on any
operating system...yet.  Consider yourself warned (again) that building hemp 
at this point in time may require a full beard, pair of sandals, an intimate
knowledge of C, your C compiler, and a fair bit of patience.  Or you might 
get lucky.

The commands shown above will install the hemp library, header files and the 
hemp program on your system.  The hemp program doesn't do anything useful yet, 
other that demonstrate that the program has compiled and linked correctly with 
the library.  

    $ hemp                              # stub program for now

You should be able to compile the hemp library into your own C programs.
Here's a simple example as a proof of concept:

    #include <stdio.h>
    #include <hemp.h>

    int main(int argc, char **argv, char **env) {
        hemp_hemp hemp = hemp_new();
        printf("created a hemp engine: %p\n", hemp);
        hemp_free(hemp);
        return 0;
    }

Assuming the above is saved in 'example.c', you would compile and link it
using a command something like this:

    $ gcc -o example -lhemp example.c

If the program compiles and run then you've successfully linked in the hemp
library.  Now you just have to twiddle your thumbs for a while until I've 
had the chance to add the functionality to makes it useful and usuable.

Platform-Specific Notes
-----------------------

Linux
-----

If you get a CMake error saying something like this:

  your CXX compiler: "CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER-NOTFOUND" was not found.

Then it probably means you haven't got the C++ compiler extensions
for gcc installed.  We're not using C++, but I haven't figured out
how to tell CMake that.  For now, just do this (or equivalent)

  $ sudo apt-get install g++

You'll also need the readline library and development header files

  $ sudo apt-get install libreadline-dev
