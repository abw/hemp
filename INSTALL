To build and install hemp:

    $ ./configure
    $ make
    $ make check
    $ sudo make install

Please be aware of the fact that this is my first time using GNU autotools
to manage the build process.  There's a fair amount of gnarly stuff going
on that I don't fully understand.  It builds on my systems (OSX and Ubuntu
Linux)), but I can't make any guarantees that it'll build on yours, especially
if you're on a non-Unix/Mac platform.  Any help improving this side of things 
would be most welcome.

The commands shown above will install the hemp library, header files and the 
hemp program on your system.  The hemp program doesn't do anything useful yet, 
other that demonstrate that the program has compiled and linked correctly with 
the library.  Note also that the hemp library itself doesn't yet do anything 
particularly useful either, so most of this is academic.

    $ hemp                              # stub program for now

You should be able to compile the hemp library into your own C programs.
Here's a simple example as a proof of concept:

    #include <stdio.h>
    #include <hemp.h>

    int main(int argc, char **argv, char **env) {
        hemp_p hemp = hemp_init();
        printf("created a hemp engine: %p\n", hemp);
        hemp_free(hemp);
        return 0;
    }

Assuming the above is saved in 'example.c', you would compile and link it
using a command something like this:

    $ gcc -o example -lhemp example.c

If the program compiles and run then you've successfully linked in the hemp
library.  Now you just have to twiddle your thumbs for a while until I've 
had the chance to add the functionality to makes it useful and usuable.
