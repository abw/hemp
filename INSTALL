To build hemp:

    $ ./configure
    $ make
    $ make check

Please be aware of the fact that this is my first time using GNU autotools
to manage the build process.  There's a fair amount of gnarly stuff going
on that I don't really understand.  It builds on my system, but I can't make
any guarantees that it'll build on yours.  Any help improving this side of 
things would be most welcome.
