Hemp is a template toolkit written in C.

The aim is to implement a similar framework to TT3 (of which a prototype
written in Perl already exists) and provide a default implementation of 
the TT3 template dialect.  However, the framework should also be extensible 
and allow other template dialects to be plugged in.  Library wrappers will 
eventually provide access to it from Perl, and perhaps other languages like 
Python, Ruby, Javascript and even PHP.  Well, that's if it ever gets anywhere.
If it does, there's a good chance it'll end up being re-written on top of 
Parrot, or something else that's better than the hodge-podge of code I've 
thrown together to get things working.  But that's a long way off yet.  It 
still might come to nothing. 

Development is at a very early "playground" stage.  At present it is focussed 
on tokenising and parsing templates into an element tree (a cross between a 
document object model as used in HTML/XML) and an opcode tree (as used to 
implement various programming languages).  There are a few tests, but nothing 
really worth looking at just yet, unless perhaps if you've got a particular 
interest in implementing mini-languages or the challenges of parsing templates.
If that's not you then please move along now.  There's nothing to see.
