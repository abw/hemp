Hemp is a template toolkit written in C.

The aim is to implement a similar framework to TT3 and provide a 
default implementation of the TT3 template dialect.  However, the
framework should also be extensible and allow other template dialects
to be plugged in.

Development is at a very early stage.  At present it's focussed on 
tokenising and parsing templates into an element tree (a cross between
a document object model as used in HTML/XML and an opcode tree as used
to implement various programming languages).
