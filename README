Hemp is a template processing toolkit/framework written in C.  Or will be, 
one day.  Maybe.

The aim is to implement a similar framework to TT3 (of which a prototype
written in Perl already exists) and provide a default implementation of 
the TT3 template language.  However, the framework should also be extensible 
and allow other template langauges (aka "dialects") to be plugged in.  

Library wrappers will eventually (maybe) provide access to it from Perl, and 
perhaps other languages like Python, Ruby, Javascript and even PHP (gak!).  
Well, that's if it ever gets anywhere.  If it does, there's a good chance 
it'll end up being re-written on top of Parrot, or something else that's 
better than the hodge-podge of code I've thrown together to get things 
working.  But that's a long way off yet.  It still might come to nothing. 

Development is at a very early "playground" stage.  At present it is focussed 
on tokenising and parsing templates into an element tree (a cross between a 
document object model as used in HTML/XML) and an opcode tree (as used to 
implement various programming languages).  There are a few tests, but nothing 
really worth looking at just yet, unless perhaps if you've got a particular 
interest in implementing mini-languages or the challenges of parsing templates.
If that's not you then please move along now.  There's nothing to see. 

You still here?  Oh, right.  Well if you're really keen then you could have 
a look at the INSTALL file for instructions on building the hemp library and 
test programs.  But don't blame me if it doesn't work, or when you realise 
that it doesn't do anything useful yet.
